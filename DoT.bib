abstract="In earlier chapters we have played around a bit with the crude death rate (CDR). We have seen that, while it is the most readily available measure of mortality, true to its name it is crude, to the point of being at times extremely misleading. Indeed, other than as a component of population growth, it is a measure to be avoided.",
