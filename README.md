## Introduction 

The Transport Health Assessment Tool for Melbourne (THAT-Melbourne) quantifies physical activity-related health impacts arising from a range of scenarios where short car trips are replaced by walking, cycling or a combination of both, based on data from metropolitan Melbourne.

The Transport Health Assessment Tool for Melbourne models scenarios for replacing short car trips with walking, cycling or a combination of both, accommodating options for trip purpose; age groups; and sex (Table 1). The model always replaces car trips. The maximum possible distance to be replaced with walking is 2 kilometres and 10 kilometres for cycling. Note that distances replaced correspond to stages of a trip, for example, a trip to work may include multiple stages including walking to a train station, train ride itself, and walking from the station to the place of employment. Trip purposes were grouped into: 1) all trips, which includes work-related, education, leisure, shopping, pick-up or drop-off someone/something, personal business, other, accompanying someone, and at or going home; 2) commuting, which includes work-related and education trips.
