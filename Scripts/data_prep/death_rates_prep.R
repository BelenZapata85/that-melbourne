  # location="Victoria"
  
  population_deaths <- read.csv(population_deaths_location,fileEncoding="UTF-8-BOM")

    dplyr::filter(States.and.Territories == location,
                  Measure %in% c("Population", "Deaths"),
                  Age %in% c(0:99),
                  Time %in% c(2016:2018), 
                  Sex != "Persons") %>%
    ### Ages to numeric. Need to convert to a character first
    mutate(Age=as.numeric(as.character(Age)))

    dplyr::mutate(rate = average/Value) %>%
    dplyr::select(age=Age, sex=Sex, rate)
  
  ### Add repeated column for age 100 (when doing Aus wide not needed as data has age 100)
  
  deaths_rates_final_add_row <- deaths_rates_final %>%
    filter(age==99) 
  deaths_rates_final_add_row$age <- 100

    mutate(sex_age_cat = paste(tolower(sex), age, sep = "_")) %>%
    dplyr::rename(mx = rate)
  
  return(deaths_rates_final)
  
  
}

### 2) Death rates with projections
#### Mortality rates are from the 3222.0 Population Projections, Australia, 2017 (base) â€“ 2066.
#### Original data probability rates are converted to rates as these are the requiered inputs for the PMSLT
#### Rates are per age and sex group with projections up to year 2066 based on medium and high improvements in life expectancy from ABS.
