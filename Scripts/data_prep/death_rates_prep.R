## Mortality rates are from the 3222.0 Population Projections, Australia, 2017 (base) â€“ 2066.
### Original data probability rates are converted to rates as these are the requiered inputs for the PMSLT
### Rates are per age and sex group with projections up to year 2066 based on medium improvements in life expectancy from ABS.

##### OLD CODE
### All cause deaths rates from Victoria to parametrise the life table
### Data is from: https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3302.02018?OpenDocument
### Compare rates to those generated in life tables for Victoria

### Get data
### The same can be done with GBD data over three years to reproduce life tables
### Need to add trends in deaths rates
