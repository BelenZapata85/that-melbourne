## Mortality rates are from the 3222.0 Population Projections, Australia, 2017 (base) â€“ 2066.
### Original data probability rates are converted to rates as these are the requiered inputs for the PMSLT
### Rates are per age and sex group with projections up to year 2066 based on medium improvements in life expectancy from ABS.
